# DigiForge Umbrel App Store

DigiForge is a custom umbrelOS community app for a private DigiByte SHA256 mining pool.

Repository: https://github.com/xlaky1/digiforge-umbrel-app-store

## Current release

**DigiForge 1.0.1** fixes the web-container startup failure found during real installation testing on umbrelOS. The default Miningcore configuration is now read from `/data/config.default.json` through the existing app config mount, avoiding the nested read-only bind mount that prevented `web_1` from starting in 1.0.0.

## Install

Add this repository to **Umbrel → App Store → Community App Stores**:

`https://github.com/xlaky1/digiforge-umbrel-app-store`

Then install **DigiForge**.
